                Wouldn’t it be really fascinating if you could open a newspaper and it will tell you exactly how your day will go? It will be able to say if you will “meet someone from your past” or “you will get money unexpectedly”. Of course newspapers have more crucial news to cover but letting people know about their days ahead has to be a great service.  In this world where everything is uncertain and unpredictable, human life is predictable.The whole credit for this kind of service goes to a section which is regular in most of the Daily newspapers. The section is nothing other than the Daily Horoscope section. 
                It is a matter of wonder how Horoscope which is dependent on Astrology can be related to newspapers. Newspapers are meant to provide facts and authentic news and it should be absolutely shunned if any journalist writes anything other than facts. But horoscopes which are nothing close to facts are okay to take its place in the newspaper. The fact that even in this era of science and technology, the Horoscope section is still present in newspapers shows that a lot of people still believe in it.

                    Let us look at how it even got included in the newspaper in the first place. It all started in 1930 when the horoscope of newborn Princess Margaret Rose of the British Royal Family was published in Sunday Express. A famous astrologer named R.H. Naylor was asked to write about it in the newspaper section. It got a lot of attention and the newspaper agency commissioned Naylor to write a section on Horoscope. That is how this newspaper was first corrupted with such baseless contents.
                    Now, if I blame only newspapers it will not be fair and unfortunately it is not only newspapers which we can blame. If we take a deeper look into our surroundings we will see how Astrology is still present in our life and how it is continuing to spread its arms around us.

           <div class="sub">
            <h4>SOCIETIES VIEW ON ASTROLOGY VS WHAT IT IS ACTUALLY?</h4>

            <p>Astrology is founded on understanding the positions of the stars, which seems like a scientific enough pursuit in itself. Reading daily horoscopes on newspapers and believing that isn't astrology since there is no scientific explanation to back up whether astrology impacts our personality, life or future! That's a bit out of it taken out of context.</p>

                <img src="images/astrologer.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>The real stuff involves a number of planets, all twelve signs, the houses and not forgetting the aspects produced in the form of a birth chart.</p>
            <p>But then again, the impacts of astrology on society in real terms is minimal. It would have been better if people studied western astrology which will have an amazing impact on society for the better. When astrology is studied in depth it provides a spiritual system not the shallow stuff in the media.</p>

                <h2>Is there any logical defense for astrology?</h2>
                <p>Astrology shows up to be logical in certain perspectives. It utilizes logical understanding of ethereal bodies, as well as scientific-sounding devices such as star charts. But a few individuals utilize astrology to anticipate future occasions and people's identities within the same way as logical hypotheses do. A few contend that crystal gazing is supported with people's individual encounters. So, a general question comes that's astrology a genuine science? Perusing horoscopes could be a common interest for a person, but is there any logical proof that it has any significance? A specialized department of soothsaying is picking up in notoriety: the prediction of a person's future or the arrangement of daily schedule by means of horoscopes. Various individuals are fascinated by soothsaying and zodiac signs. They grow their personal interest to examine, know and think about the stars for future translation. Understanding the positions of the stars is the prime establishment of astrology, which shows up to be a logical discipline. In any case, Is there any logical proof that crystal gazing or astrology has an effect on our identities and livelihoods? In a nutshell, the reply is no.
                    Nowadays,there's a human inclination to blend up astrology with cosmology and astronomy, or indeed more awful, to respect one as a reasonable substitute for the other. There's a reason for cosmology. The capacity of expecting and overseeing for certain key events, such as the changing of the seasons and the sowing of crops, was made conceivable by analyzing the development of these planets. In any case, there are a few old space experts who accept that ethereal arrangements and human activities have “synchronization”. The celestial objects within the night sky had a specific impact on mankind. Well, this was fair to a devotee of them. Astrology is more like a superstitious belief with logical explanation. The roots of astrology is an ancient idea traced since the Mesopotamian age. It tricks the people saying that it is supernatural and today this has paved it’s to our daily life through newspapers, magazines, and television. Using the ancient framework, the astrologers generated their own sets of rules. They used these to claim that the future can be predicted with their calculations. Unfortunately, people fall into their traps believing it to be a prophecy. There are many studies that say that astrology is just a coincidence.
                    
                    A few astrologers say that since astrology is based on numbers, it may not be rectified for a specific individual. In case their hypothesis is rectified, there ought to be a connection between visionary legend and the numerous zodiac signs that individuals are born beneath. Researchers have attempted difficult to demonstrate this speculation, but no connection has ever been found.
                    Pseudoscience alludes to logical areas that are established on hypothesis but need a steady body of information to back them up. One among them is the home of crystal gazing. The qualification between science and pseudoscience is between objective reality and subjective recognition. Pseudoscience misshapes genuine logical advance and empowers anti-intellectual opinions. Supernatural quality and enchantment substitute investigation and finding. Stargazers resolvedly negate this and fervently restrict any endeavors to meddle with astrology's exactness. Researchers engage in intellectual recreations with certain rules that must be complied. They are willing to acknowledge what comes about that can be demonstrated through rehashed perceptions or tests, or by creating testable expectations. Crystal gazing does not meet these requirements. Simply said, astrology's fundamentals give inexhaustible proof of its strangeness.Astrology's impacts don't exist within the universe.

            <p>As a result, astrology has become a con these days. Artists and social media have a huge impact on the general public and innocent individuals. Because they were acquitted, fraudsters are more likely to take advantage of them. These scam artists deceive the general public into parting with a large sum of money. Some businesses and corporations have also fallen victim to these con artists' devious schemes. Nowadays, there are a lot of internet scams. As a result, the general people should be more conscious of how they use the internet and should place a greater emphasis on science rather than astrology. And last but not the least, we all should remember that we belong from the 21st century and are celebrating the golden era of modern science and technology. </p>
